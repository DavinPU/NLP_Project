# NLP_Project
Our project is  system that allows users to view presidential opinions on topics. For example, what does Joe Biden say about the “economy”? What are the summarizations of his speeches where he displayed a positive or negative sentiment? This system will allow users to better understand the political ideologies of the presidents.
